# sentiment_analysis_with_vader_and_roberta
Here you can see how to perform sentiment analysis via Roberta and Vader models. Roberta, developed by Hugging Face, and trained on Twitter data performs better than Vader. However, they are both poor in understanding sarcasm. A way to improve the model would be to train it specifically on Amazon data and using the reviews, in star, as a clue on the valence of the comments, by giving a high bias to 1 and 5 star reviews, a medium bias to 2 and 4 star reviews, and a neutral bias to 3 stars reviews.
